This blog is written by Jamie Finlay in an effort to diarise all things Ruby, Rails and
web development he has learned.

Jamie currently works as a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, 
where he teaches on the Product Design Engineering programme. He hopes one day to combine 
programming and travel.

Interests include programming, cooking and world-wide travel.
